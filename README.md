# C# Web application

Attempt at creating a web application using ASP.NET core (MVC)

## Notes:

1. Creation of application using `dotnet new mvc -au Individual` for a MVC web application & individual authentication
2. To run application `dotnet run`

- Will show in terminal what port to go on.
  Currently `https://localhost:7007/` or `http://localhost:5107/`

### Issues:

- Visual Studio on macOS compatability is not great (no terminal to migrate data)
- Attempting application with VSC.
